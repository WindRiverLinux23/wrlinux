This template will enable selinux in a given distribution.  For full use
you will need to provide a proper reference policy for selinux.

The reference policy providers are refpolicy-mcs, refpolicy-mls,
refpolicy-standard, refpolicy-minimum, refpolicy-targeted.

Note these reference policies will still require modification to
function properly in your configuration.

In your local.conf file you need to set the preferred policy, such as:
  PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/refpolicy = "refpolicy-standard"

By default, the refpolicy-mls will be used.

By default, the selinux contexts of system will be labeled on first boot
via autorelabel service. To enable labeling selinux contexts at build
time, set FIRST_BOOT_RELABEL = "0" in your local.conf.
